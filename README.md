# Building a simple calculator APP with React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Live version on [Heroku](https://magicians-calculator.herokuapp.com/)

## Built With:

- Node.js
- React
- React-DOM
- React-Create-App
- npm
- CSS
- ES6

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

`yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

`yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
